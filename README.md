# My config files

Also:

 * install `aspell` to have spell checking in emacs (and everywhere)
 * `pip install elpy rope jedi` for all the emacs-python love from elpy

On a mac also:

 * `System Preferences...` `Keyboard` `Modifier Keys...` Caps Lock to Control
 * [KeyRemap4MacBook][1] `Command_R to Option_R`
 * The nice default-provided font in Terminal is called "Menlo".


### Other things to consider:

 * It seems like [vcsh][2] might be the eventual awesome way to do
   configs. With [myrepos][3] probably. See: [Manage Your Configs
   with vcsh][4]
