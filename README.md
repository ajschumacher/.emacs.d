# My config files

On a mac also:

 * `System Preferences...` `Keyboard` `Modifier Keys...` Caps Lock to Control
 * [KeyRemap4MacBook][1] `Command_R to Option_R`
 * The nice default-provided font in Terminal is called "Menlo".


### To do

 * make/improve setup script to include setting up git user name,
   generating ssh key and presenting it to be copied into github, etc.
 * tell emacs to not generate ~ files
 * [git completion][2]?


### Other things to consider:

 * It seems like `[vcsh][3]` might be the eventual awesome way to do
   configs. With `[myrepos][4]` probably. See: [Manage Your Configs
   with vcsh][5]
