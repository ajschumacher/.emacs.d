# My config files

On a mac also:
 * `System Preferences...` `Keyboard` `Modifier Keys...` Caps Lock to Control
 * [KeyRemap4MacBook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) `Command_R to Option_R`
 * The nice default-provided font in Terminal is called "Menlo".

### Todo

 * make/improve setup script to include setting up git user name, generating ssh key and presenting it to be copied into github, etc.
 * tell emacs to not generate ~ files
 * [git completion](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash)?

### Other things to consider:

 * It seems like `vcsh` might be the eventual awesome way to do configs. See:
