The Emacs Lisp Python Environment in Emacs

Elpy is an Emacs package to bring powerful Python editing to Emacs.
It combines a number of existing Emacs packages, and uses one of a
selection of Python packages for code introspection.

To use, you need to install not only this package, but a few Python
packages as well. See the installation instructions on the wiki.

Documentation is available there as well.
