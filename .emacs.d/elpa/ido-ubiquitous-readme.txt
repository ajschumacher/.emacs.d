If you use the excellent `ido-mode' for efficient completion of
file names and buffers, you might wonder if you can get ido-style
completion everywhere else too. Well, that's what this package
does! ido-ubiquitous is here to enable ido-style completion for
(almost) every function that uses the standard completion function
`completing-read'.
